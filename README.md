# GateGuardian

GateGuardian is a lightweight GMOD whitelisting addon created by 'bathdabomb' or 'Quantix' (https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198164621602/)
which allows a nice user friendly way to enable whitelists and blacklists.

## Instructions

Gate Guardian is a simple, user-friendly method of whitelisting or blacklisting users.
All you really have to do is install it via workshop or below method, and then open the menu (in-game) via '!whitelist' in chat.

To add users to the whitelist/blacklist you get their steam profile link (https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198164621602) or their ID and put it into the text entry.

(NOTE) If you want to add the users manually you can go into your garrysmod data folder and find a file named 'gateguardian_data.json'. This file will contain the settings and users you have whitelisted, if you want to add them manually or without joining the game that is the best way to do it.

## Manual Installation

If you want to install this, it is highly recommended to install via the steam workshop https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1911753630

(but if you want to install it from git directly you can follow these steps)
1. Download the files and put them into a folder named 'GateGuardian'
2. Remove the 'readme' and 'license' txt files as it will mess gmod up.
3. Put that folder into your GarrysMod Addons folder (usually: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons)
4. Restart Garrys Mod and it should be installed.
5. Take note that git downloads will not auto update, and it is recommended to get the workshop version.
